Bot features:

Default prefix: !
Use !help for user help, or !adminhelp for help on how to set up the bot.

This bot is not intended for scalable use, but uses Amazon S3 services to store server role preferences, and Heroku to host the bot.

If you wish to use this app with other services than S3 or Heroku, it will be necessary to change the methods relating to saving and loading data, as well as the requires.

Have fun moderating!
